case statements

you can use case statements to create a menu, and have a user check the menu.  See 'case_statements.sh' for the example.


case statement allows us to do something dependingon what the variable is.  in the example, it is the distro variable, containing whatever the user types.

case checks and see if distro is equal to 1, or the user pressed 1 and hit enter.  It will compare all options.  The wildcard is a catchall, in the event the user enters something that is not a match.

every single case statement ends in two semi-colons, except the last.  WIth multiple commands you can put the ending semmi-colons on a different line, in case if  you needed to enter more than one command.
